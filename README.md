Meet Your Friendly Neighborhood Grocery Helper
Tired of fumbling with paper lists and mental math at the grocery store? I built a simple, smart digital helper to take the stress out of the checkout process!

This Grocery Billing System is like a friendly, old-fashioned shopkeeper living inside your computer. It knows the price of all your essentials—from a bag of rice to a stick of butter. You just tell it what you want and how much, and it takes care of the rest, carefully tallying everything up without any mistakes.

Here’s how it works:

You walk in (so to speak), and it immediately shows you a clear list of everything available. Feeling like pancakes? You can add flour, milk, and butter to your digital basket. Just type in the item's name and how many you need. Changed your mind? No problem, you can keep adding items until you say you're "done."

The best part is the final bill. It doesn't just spit out a total. It neatly lays out everything you bought, shows you the cost before tax, calculates a small 5% GST, and gives you the final, honest amount you need to pay, all stamped with the date and time. It’s a quick, transparent, and hassle-free way to see exactly what you're spending.

I built this not just as a coding project, but to create a helpful little tool that makes a everyday task a bit smoother and more pleasant. It’s my small way of bringing a touch of friendly, organized simplicity to your day.
